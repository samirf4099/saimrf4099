        		<h1>My Life Story (You Probably Don't Care, So Leave This Page and Move On If You Don't)</h1>
				<p>I was born somewhere in South Carolina. I have a military family, so I moved a lot. My dad is in the Marines, my mom's sister is in the Marines, my dad's sister is in the Army, and my stepmom is in the Navy. I want to be in the Air Force when I'm 18 or something.<em> I've moved 4 times, from SC to NC, NC, to RI, from RI back to NC, then my parents divorced, then NC to NY. </em> Don't trust me. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
