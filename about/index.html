        		<h1>My Life Story (You Probably Don't Care, So Leave This Page and Move On If You Don't)</h1>
				<p>I was born somewhere in South Carolina. I have a military family, so I moved a lot. My dad is in the Marines, my mom's sister is in the Marines, my dad's sister is in the Army, and my stepmom is in the Navy. I want to be in the Air Force when I'm 18 or something. I've moved 4 times, from SC to NC, NC, to RI, from RI back to NC, then my parents divorced, then NC to NY. I've been bullied from 1st through 5th grade. Yeah, tough life, I know.
