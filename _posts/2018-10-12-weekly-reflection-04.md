# Part 1: Our Learning
  Today we learned how to make an image, using two images and overlapping them to make a collage. One connection I can make to this lesson is to the week of October 1st, which was when we created images with contracts. That week, we created images as well, but it wasn't like we did this week with the overlapping. We created a single image, which, I beleive, was to prepare us for what was this week.
# Part 2: My Learning
  A challenge I had today was that I couldm't get the pictures to overlap. I followed the directions correctly, so I don't know what happened. But maybe next week, I'll be able to get it. After all, it was only our first try for creating a collage.
