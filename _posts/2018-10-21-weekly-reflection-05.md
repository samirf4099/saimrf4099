# Part 1: What We Worked On
This week we worked on our flag projects. The process to create a national flag by programming is not as simple as it sounds. You need to create all of the shapes that are in the the flag, then put them into a single image. In order to create an original image, you need the following in this order, beginning with a parenthesis: name of the function (ex: star), size of image (ex: 50), mode (ex: "solid"), and lastly, color (ex: red).
# Part 2: Challenges and Opportunities
I had some down moments, but also some up moments. A down moment I had was putting all of the images into one image. It was confusing at first, but I started to comprehend it. An up moment was making the images. I figured out how to keep putting images into the same image. You just have to define them. So when you want to put an image into another image, you don't have to put down the whole contract.
