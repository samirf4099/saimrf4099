# Part 1 - My Flag
I did the Norwegian flag. It consists of rectangles and squares. They are both simple shapes. So my flag is a collection of simple shapes. For a square, the function would be this: ```(rectangle 450 100 "solid" "blue")```. For a square, it would be this: ```(square 50 "solid" "blue")```.
# Part 2 - Questions and Challenges
One question asked this week was, "What made this difficult?" And I was about to say nothing, that is, until I realized that there were some major challenges. First of these challenges was that I didn't have a good base for my flag. Another challenge was I didn't make good measurements because I was in a hurry. And that leads me to my third challenge, which was Mr. Allatta didn't give us enough time. He said, "By the end of this period, I expect these flags done." It was 9:27 a.m, so that put all of us on edge (sorry Mr. Allatta, just saying). Another question that was asked was, "What could I do differently if I started from scratch?" My answer to that was that maybe I could have better construction paper, better measurements, more time, and more tools.
