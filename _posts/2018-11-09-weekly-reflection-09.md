This week we built more on our knowledge of functions. We did a function that only had one string: (define AGE (14)). But that's not correct way to write it. When we add a parenthesis, the computer expects a funtion to come after it. There is no function before the number 14. So it should be this: 
```(define AGE 14)```
Contracts are the layout of what the image output will be. We can make examples of these. We can define functions, which is the name of the contract. We can make examples of these.
