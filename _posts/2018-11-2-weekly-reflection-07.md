  This week has been ok, I guess. We learned how to apply function applications to contracts so that it's easier for us to write the expression, and as a result, create the image/output. We also learned about the domain and range of a contract. The domain is the number and the two strings. The range is the image created. We also learned about function definitions. We defines a triangle using gt20, since one of the contracts had a size of 20 for the triangle. We define it to the contract. But, this week was, indeed, okay.
