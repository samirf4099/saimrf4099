  I feel great about computer science! I feel much more confident than I was before about this kind of stuff (i.e. coding). This stuff is awesome dude! I think I'll be ok for the rest of this class!
  I think I've learned a lot at this point. I learned about circles of evaluation, which is basically how a computer thinks. We've done problems with circles of evaluation in class, which are fun! Mr. Allatta is cool, man.
  Some of my challenges will probably be complex circles of evaluation. But that's ok, 'cuz I've got my partner to help me (his name is Joe)! I've had some other challenges, too. I've had some trouble with my website, I was having trouble posting stuff, but I found out how to fix it all.
  This is going to be a fun year, I know it!
