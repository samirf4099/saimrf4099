 This week was pretty quick! Probably because we had no school on Tuesday...but anyway. Today we learned about fast functions. We had to create contracts based on the information that we were given. We wrote definitions that corresponded with the contract itself. We were tasked of creating the function that was described to us. One problem wanted us to define the triangle as gt, that was solid and was green. The size could have been any number, from 1 to 100. Negative numbers don't work, and neither does zero, because, you know, it's literally nothing. The result function was this (define gt size (triangle size "solid" "green").
