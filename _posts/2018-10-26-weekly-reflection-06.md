# Part 1: The First Benchmark
It is the end of the first third of the semester. A benchmark, you may call it. We've learned a lot up to this point. The following will be a summary of what we did; we learned how to make contracts (ex: star 50 "solid" "blue"), we learned about functions (ex: star, square, triangle, circle, rectangle), we learned how to rotate the image, we learned how to scale the image, we learned how to put an image into another image, and we also learned how to define.
# Part 2: Connections
There are a lot of connections I can make throughout this first benchmark. One connection I can make is the flag project to the contracts and defining lessons. We used contracts to make the images, but we used definitions to identify the images so we didn't have to use the contracts everytime we wanted to overlay an image into another. Another connection I can make is to the put-image lesson. We overlayed images onto each other to create a complex design. It was preparation to the flag project. The last connection I can make is to the functions lesson. Functions are the part of the contract that allow the actual contract to create the desired image.
# Part 3: Challenges and Opportunities 
I've had a lot of challenges and opportunities during this first benchmark. A challenge I've had was during the "put-image" activity. I was so confused as to how I was supposed to overlay an image into another. But I later figured out that I could just define the different images, so I didn't have to use the whole contract! I also figured out you can do the same to the "put-image" contract! Those two were opportunities, by the way. I just get so carried away, I don't even know what I'm writing anymore! Moving on, another challenge that I had was creating contracts. I was so confused on how to do it. I followed every single step on how to create one... or so I thought. Apparenty, my mistake was that I added ";" before "star" and ":" after "star." I also forgot to add " before and after "solid" and "red."
# Part 4: Moving Forward
This past Friday (October 26, 2018) marked the end of the first third of the semester. From this point on, we will be focusing on our current objectives and the tasks that lay ahead of us and beyond. This was an amazing benchmark period and I will never forget the things that we've done (I'm writing this as if it's my last will and testament before I move on to college) throughout this benchmark. I've met a lot of people and I'm looking forward to meeting more! It's time to move forward!
