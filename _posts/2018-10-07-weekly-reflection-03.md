 This week, I learned how to create an image on the computer. It's fairly easy, but it's quite the challenge! The computer requires a function to create an image, and the contents of the function have to be in a specific order. First up goes the name of the function, which determines the shape (example: ;star:). Second goes the number, which determines the size of the shape (example: 50). Third is how you want your shape to look like, "solid" being fully shaded in, or "outline," with the shape only visible with it's edges shaded in. Lastly is the color, and we all know what that does (in case you don't know, which you should, the color allows to make the shape the color you desire). So your function should look something that's exactly like this: (star 50 "outline" "blue).
