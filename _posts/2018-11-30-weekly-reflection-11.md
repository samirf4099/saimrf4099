This week on Monday we took the midterm for computer science. To me, some of the questions were actually easy. There was this one question, though, which kept me thinking about it for a while. I had Version 1 of the midterm, so it was question 1 for it. It asked, "What is the value of the 3rd argument of the innermost function in ```(scale 2 (circle 40 "solid" "blue"))```? I chose (c) as my answer, because I initially thought that circle was the first argument, and 40 was the second. But I soon realized that circle is just the function name, not a value. Values are in the domain, which is the size, mode and color. The value of the 3rd argument is actually "blue".
